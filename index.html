                <h3>Vibb.online</h3>
                <img src="media/project1.png" alt="">
                <p><strong>Vibb.online</strong> is a satirical web-based parody of modern dating apps, designed to mock the superficial and repetitive nature of online matchmaking platforms. As the lead developer, I oversaw both the frontend and backend development of the project using <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p>
                <p>After logging in with demo credentials, users are greeted with humorous profiles, over-the-top bios, and a mock chat system designed to poke fun at real-life dating app clichés. I developed a fully functional login system using PHP sessions, built randomized profile generation logic, and styled the interface to mimic the sleek but sometimes shallow appearance of popular apps like Tinder or Bumble.</p>
                <p>I also implemented responsive layouts to ensure mobile usability, and scripted interactive elements to simulate swiping, matching, and messaging features—though all interactions are intentionally exaggerated or broken for comedic effect. The entire experience is self-contained and was designed to highlight both my technical abilities and my creativity when it comes to storytelling and UI design.</p>
                <p>This project deepened my understanding of full-stack web development, user session management, and responsive design. It was also an opportunity to experiment with content-driven UX and dark humor in digital interfaces.</p>

                <h3>Tactile Horror Prototype</h3>
                <video src="media/project2-demo.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline ></video>
                <p>This is a prototype for a psychological horror game made in Unity. It focuses on immersive exploration and detailed object interaction, inspired by games like <em>Visage</em> and <em>Layers of Fear</em>.</p>

                <h4>Item Interaction System</h4>
                <p>Players can pick up objects, rotate them freely in 3D space, and return them to their original positions. This system encourages close inspection and supports puzzle-solving through environmental storytelling.</p>

                <h4>Design Purpose</h4>
                <p>The interaction mechanics let players uncover clues hidden on objects and solve environmental puzzles, reinforcing immersion and tension in the game world.</p>

                <h4>Technical Approach</h4>
                <p>Built using modular scripts, a central interaction manager, and temporary physics suspension, the system is designed to be clean, scalable, and flexible for future content.</p>

                <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                <p>This project strengthened my skills in Unity input systems, 3D object manipulation, and designing immersive mechanics that contribute to gameplay and narrative.</p>

                <h3>RPi remote control with camera</h3>
                <img src="media/project1.png" alt="">
                <p>This project is a web-controlled robot built using a Raspberry Pi, created in collaboration with Albin Persson. It features both a Python-based client for hardware control and a PHP-based server for the browser interface.</p>
                <p>Users can connect through a web browser to remotely view the robot’s camera feed and send movement commands. The client script interprets these commands to control motors and manage real-time video streaming from the Raspberry Pi’s camera module.</p>
                <p>The project demonstrates a practical implementation of robotics, networking, and browser-based control, making it a hands-on exploration of IoT systems using accessible technologies.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-card">
            <p>I chose the Technology program because I have been interested in computers and programming since I was a child. It felt like a natural choice for me, as I have always wanted to understand how technology works and how to create with it.</p>
            <p>During my time at high school, I have deepened my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and version control with Git. I have also learned to work with remote control via VNC, especially in projects involving a Raspberry Pi. Additionally, I have developed basic skills in PHP and continued to improve my Python knowledge.</p>
            <p>What I find most rewarding about programming is the opportunity to solve problems in creative ways. I love the feeling of having an idea and then testing if I have the skills and knowledge to bring it to life—whether it’s building a game or developing a technical system from scratch.</p>
            <p>I am not completely sure what I want to do in the future yet, but I know I want to work in IT or computer technology. I have previously dreamed of becoming a game developer or starting my own company, and although my plans evolve over time, my goal is to have a career where I can work with technology and problem-solving.</p>
            <p>In projects, I like to take responsibility and plan how to approach the task in a structured way. I am goal-oriented and committed to completing projects with high quality, always striving to deliver a result I can be proud of.</p>
            <p>One of my greatest strengths in technology and programming is my problem-solving ability. I enjoy analyzing challenges and finding effective, creative solutions that work in practice.</p>
            <p>I want visitors to feel that I am passionate and engaged in what I do. That they get the impression I am driven, determined, and truly passionate about technology and programming.</p>
