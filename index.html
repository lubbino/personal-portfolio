                <h3>Vibb.online</h3>
                <img src="media/project1.png" alt="">
                <p><strong>Vibb.online</strong> is a satirical web-based parody of modern dating apps, designed to mock the superficial and repetitive nature of online matchmaking platforms. As the lead developer, I oversaw both the frontend and backend development of the project using <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p>
                <p>After logging in with demo credentials, users are greeted with humorous profiles, over-the-top bios, and a mock chat system designed to poke fun at real-life dating app clichés. I developed a fully functional login system using PHP sessions, built randomized profile generation logic, and styled the interface to mimic the sleek but sometimes shallow appearance of popular apps like Tinder or Bumble.</p>
                <p>I also implemented responsive layouts to ensure mobile usability, and scripted interactive elements to simulate swiping, matching, and messaging features—though all interactions are intentionally exaggerated or broken for comedic effect. The entire experience is self-contained and was designed to highlight both my technical abilities and my creativity when it comes to storytelling and UI design.</p>
                <p>This project deepened my understanding of full-stack web development, user session management, and responsive design. It was also an opportunity to experiment with content-driven UX and dark humor in digital interfaces.</p>

                <h3>Tactile Horror Prototype</h3>
                <video src="media/project2-demo.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline ></video>
                <p>This is a prototype for a psychological horror game made in Unity. It focuses on immersive exploration and detailed object interaction, inspired by games like <em>Visage</em> and <em>Layers of Fear</em>.</p>

                <h4>Item Interaction System</h4>
                <p>Players can pick up objects, rotate them freely in 3D space, and return them to their original positions. This system encourages close inspection and supports puzzle-solving through environmental storytelling.</p>

                <h4>Design Purpose</h4>
                <p>The interaction mechanics let players uncover clues hidden on objects and solve environmental puzzles, reinforcing immersion and tension in the game world.</p>

                <h4>Technical Approach</h4>
                <p>Built using modular scripts, a central interaction manager, and temporary physics suspension, the system is designed to be clean, scalable, and flexible for future content.</p>

                <h4>What I Learned</h4>
                <p>This project strengthened my skills in Unity input systems, 3D object manipulation, and designing immersive mechanics that contribute to gameplay and narrative.</p>
